                <h3> Prototyping </h3>
                <p> Coming with a background in the Adobe Suites, learning Figma seemed like second nature. I have found a great deal of pleasure in learning new design and organization tactics in Figma and I think this is exemplified in my work. </p>

                <h3> Visual Design </h3>
                <p> I have always been one to pay close attention to the details. There is an immense amount of importance linked with a color palette because of the emotion that a set of colors can evoke. I have taken it upon myself to identify appropriate color palettes and typography to go with them. </p>

                <h3> User Research </h3>
                <p> With several years experience in sales and management, communication is a strongsuit of mine. Having conversations and identifying a partiuclar user's needs or guiding them through a prototype is something I do very well. </p>

                        For this project, I leveraged the research I conducted to develop an application that would increase Darc Sport’s brand presence, enhance the user experience for their consumers, and solidify Darc Sport’s position as a top player in the fitness apparel industry.

                        Our objective was to redesign a local non-profit website for both mobile and desktop. We chose The Pink Cloud Foundation as our project site, and over 3 weeks, we completed a responsive hi-fidelity redesign of the homepage and associated pages concerned with a chosen user path, as well as a completed style guide for the redesigned site.

                    <p>
                        In this project, I undertook a comprehensive redesign of the US Department of Education's website, focusing on improving user experience across both mobile and desktop platforms. By implementing user-centered design principles and conducting thorough research, I crafted intuitive navigation, streamlined content organization, and visually appealing interfaces. The result is a user-friendly digital platform that enhances accessibility, facilitates information discovery, and fosters engagement with educational resources for all stakeholders.
